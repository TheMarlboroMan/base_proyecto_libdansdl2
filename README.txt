# what is this?

This project depends on libdansdl2:

Also depends on:

This is a small example of a C++ / SDL2 application framework. Since the application framework was updated with "kana_dication" this repository is mostly obsolete and not recommended for new applications. Still, all code and examples should work correctly.

There are two controllers here: intro controller with some graphics and another controller with a color changing background.

SPACE and ESCAPE are the only allowed inputs.

This repository is pending a massive update that will change the framework. It's not likely to be done until "kana_dictation" is finished and I feel like it.

# archiving

As of September 2022 this repository is archived and no more changes will be made. It has been a few years since the "dfw" was made as a successor to this project.
